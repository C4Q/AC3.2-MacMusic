In order to get these APIs, we went through multiple websites
We don't want to do the same ideas as others

What is API?
In computer programming, an application programming interface (API) is a set of subroutine definitions, protocols, and tools for building software and applications. A good API makes it easier to develop a program by providing all the building blocks, which are then put together by the programmer.

Tips to use API
1. Don't give up easily when stuck
When stuck, Google more information by searching relevant terms. 
When the documentations are not very clear, as we looking throw the link:
https://developer.musixmatch.com/documentation
We turned into stack overflow for more information
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17165228/how-to-get-lyrics-from-musixmatch
After this we were able to get the data and implement it in our project.

2. Be prepared for challenges
When using the Apple's API, the data was parsed successfully. Unfortunately, the link was not connected correctly when opened on the phone. It opened the music app without opening the specific album. However, the link opened expectedly in a browser on the phone. This was strange, but instead of spending more time on this issue. I worked on another API to connect the song to a YouTube link.

### NSUserDefaults

I worked on NSUserDefaults, appending NSUserDefaults turned out to be a bit of a challenge because I encountered a problem that I hadn't seen before nor thought about. I spoke to Jason and Louis, both TAs, who helped me figure out the problem I was having. The problem was that everytime I added a song's data to NSUSerDefaults I would replace the songs I had with the new song I added. What I should of been doing is assigning the UserDefaults to a variable, appending it and then setting the appended variable to USerDefaults. This was a simple fix, but one that I will remember to do and think about in other scenarious that are the same or similar.

### Changing image when selected

Something interesting I also learned was changing an image when it has been selected. This too was simple to do, but something that I had no idea how to do prior to this project. Once I learned how to do it, I used the same method to change other buttons.
