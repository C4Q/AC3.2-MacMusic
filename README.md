In order to get these APIs, we went through multiple websites
We don't want to do the same ideas as others

What is API?
In computer programming, an application programming interface (API) is a set of subroutine definitions, protocols, and tools for building software and applications. A good API makes it easier to develop a program by providing all the building blocks, which are then put together by the programmer.

Tips to use API
1. Don't give up easily when stuck
    When stuck, Google more information by searching relevant terms. 
        When the documentations are not very clear, as we looking throw the link:
        https://developer.musixmatch.com/documentation
        We turned into stack overflow for more information
        http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17165228/how-to-get-lyrics-from-musixmatch
        After this we were able to get the data and implement it in our project.
2. Be prepared for challenges
    When using the Apple's API, the data was parsed successfully. Unfortunately, the link was not connected correctly when opened on the phone. It opened the music app without opening the specific album. However, the link opened expectedly in a browser on the phone. This was strange, but instead of spending more time on this issue. I worked on another API to connect the song to a YouTube link.
